# üìù Article Summarization Using with NN and ML

# Article Summary

## Overview
Article Summary is a web application that summarizes long articles into concise summaries using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and traditional machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Decision Tree Regressor.

## Purpose
The project aims to provide users with quick and accurate summaries of lengthy articles, leveraging both deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques to cater to different summarization needs.

## Key Features
- **Summary with LSTM**: Generates summaries using a deep learning model based on Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM.
- **Summary with Logistic Regression**: Uses logistic regression for text summarization.
- **Summary with Linear Regression**: Applies linear regression for summarization tasks.
- **Summary with Decision Tree Classifier**: Employs a decision tree classifier for summary generation.
- **Summary with Decision Tree Regressor**: Utilizes a decision tree regressor for summarization.

## Dataset
The project uses the [CNN/DailyMail dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gowrishankarp/newspaper-text-summarization-cnn-dailymail) from Kaggle for training and testing the models. It has id, article, highlight columns.

## Tech Stack / Libraries Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web-based user interface.
- **TensorFlow**: For implementing the LSTM-based deep learning model.
- **Scikit-learn**: For traditional machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Decision Tree Regressor).
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading trained models and vectorizers.
